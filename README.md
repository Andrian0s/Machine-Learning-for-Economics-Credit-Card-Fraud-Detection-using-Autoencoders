# Machine-Learning-for-Economics-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Autoencoders

This was an Assignment for ML For Economic Analysis at University of Zurich and involved the research, development, of a classification system for Credit Card fraud System and the Economic significance and analysis of performance of such a system.

This topic was interesting choice, as the large imbalance of class for Credit Card Fraud makes typical ML techniques are to learn a lot. With the use of Autoencoders to create Hidden representations allows accurate classification on a heavily imbalanced dataset. This is only an initial research and an invitation for further work on the topic.
